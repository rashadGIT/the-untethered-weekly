Who are you…\nbeing when the sales conversations get tough?\n\n#womenwhosell #womeninsales #selfimage
Get over yourself.\n\nOn the first night of 2026, I was walking down the street recording a video when a group of men— who probably didn’t expect me to engage with them at all—ended up in the clip.\n\nI could’ve been distant.\nI could’ve shut it down.\nI could’ve been rude and guarded.\n\nInstead, I engaged.\n\nBecause I was OM.\nOver myself.\n\nWhat I learned decades ago from John C. Maxwell is:\nthe first step in leadership is getting over yourself\nthe first step in connection is getting over yourself\nthe first step in communication is getting over yourself\nthe first step in serving more people is getting over yourself \nthe first step in selling more is getting over yourself\n\nUntethered sellers understand this. \nThey create connection with humans wherever they go. \nPeople feel comfortable in their presence.\n\nThat’s what happens when you untether from your comfort zone.\n\nThat’s what happens when you choose courage and stop rehearsing, guarding, and deciding in advance how you’ll be perceived.\n\nGet over yourself.\n\n#theuntetheredseller #womenwhosell #womeninsales

If you’re not closing, it’s rarely a closing issue.\nIt’s a conversation issue.\n\nLast month, I was at the Waterfront Mall in Cape Town when two young women walked up to me.\n\nWe’d never met.\nThey had no idea I wasn’t from their country.\nAnd none of that mattered.\n\nThey saw a woman they identified with, started a conversation, and then decided whether to extend their invitation.\n\nThey didn’t overthink it.\nThey didn’t wait for a signal.\nThey initiated—and listened.\n\nThat’s how momentum is built.\n\nWhen sellers aren’t closing, it’s usually because they aren’t prospecting enough.\n\nAnd a low pipeline makes every no feel heavier than it is.\n\nBecause you can’t keep talking to the same five or six prospects and expect different results.\n\nThere are more people to meet.\nMore conversations to have.\nMore yeses outside your current prospects.\n\nUntethered sellers don’t linger.\nThey keep moving.\n\nSo when things feel heavy, it’s often not emotional—it’s mathematical.\n\nOdds are, you just haven’t met enough people.\n\n✨sell yourself on that\n\n#theuntetheredseller #courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #prospect
Stay Calm. \n\nWhen a prospect goes quiet,\nyour brain wants you to believe that something went wrong.\n\nThe truth?\n\nThey’re busy.\nThey’re deciding.\nThey’re aligning stakeholders.\nThey’re prioritizing.\n\nStay calm.\nNothing has gone wrong.\n\nSome of the strongest sales I’ve closed took months—not days.\nBecause I stayed visible instead of emotional.\nConsistent instead of frustrated.\n\nIf you’ve chosen to sell,\nyou can’t tether your behavior to silence.\n\nStay calm.\nStay seen.\nStay in the conversation.\n\n✨sell yourself on that\n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #fearofrejection #theuntetheredseller
Do you see the truth in the Les Brown quote?\n\nI do. And it led me to this realization:\n\nMost women sellers aren’t serving at the level they’re capable of — not because they lack skill, but because they’re tethered to comfort.\n\n✨ready to untether?\n✨dm me\n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales
Seeing all of the New York Fashion Week posts this weekend reminds me of the incredible time I had attending #NYFW earlier this spring. \n\nFor me, it was more than a glamorous event; it was a powerful reminder to dream big, partner with my creativity and then cultivate the courage to express it. \n\nWhile watching the models gracefully strut down the runway, showcasing the innovative designs of talented fashion creators, I was struck by a powerful realization. It’s not just about the clothes; it’s about the mindset. I was inspired to “think like a fashion designer” and apply the principles of the fashion world to my own life.\n\nFashion designers live in a world where change is not only embraced but eagerly anticipated. They constantly push the boundaries of their creativity, welcoming the desire for something new and exciting. Every year, they show up at New York Fashion Week with fresh approaches, strategies, and bold displays of their work.\n\nEmphasis on “they” – they show up. They allow themselves and their work to be seen, unapologetically. They sell themselves on themselves, believing in their creative vision with unwavering confidence.\n\nNow, let me ask you: What would your life, business, or career look like if you stopped shying away from your creativity, your craft, and your calling? What if you cultivated the courage to embrace change in a way you’ve never done before, shifting from a constant state of shyness to a constant state of success?\n\nImagine being untethered from your comfort zone. Seeing yourself boldly stepping onto your personal runway, showcasing your unique talents and ideas to the world. Just like those designers at New York Fashion Week, you can sell yourself on yourself, believing that your dreams are not only attainable but worth pursuing with passion and determination.\n\nThe magic of New York Fashion Week is that it reminds us that the size of our dreams must always exceed our current capacity to achieve them. If they do not scare us, they are not big enough.\n\n✨sell yourself on that \n✨save and share this.\n✨subscribe to the untethered weekly\n✨link in bio\n\n#whatif #couragewins #fashionweeknyc #couragecoach

Waiting to feel confident?\n\nSales rewards the seller who’s sold on, “I’ll be fine REGARDLESS of the outcome.”\n\n#theuntetheredseller #womenwhosell #womeninsales
Can I remind you of something?\n\nYou didn’t lose value—and neither did what you sell—because a sale didn’t close.\n\nThink about a $100 bill.\nYou can crumple it.\nDrop it on the floor.\nStep on it.\n\nAnd it’s still worth one hundred dollars.\n\nWhat you sell didn’t stop solving problems.\n\nAnd you didn’t suddenly become less capable.\n\n#theuntetheredseller #WomenWhoSell
I Have A Dream\n\nLes Brown once said, “Most people aren’t living their dreams because they are too busy living their fears.”\n\nWhat I’ve observed through my work is this—\nmany women who sell are not helping enough people live their dreams—not because they lack talent, intelligence, or capability, but because fear interrupts their willingness to sell their product, service, or offer.\n\nThat decision serves no one.\n\nI am Shannon Muruli, Courage Coach and Self-Image Strategist to women who sell.\nAnd I, too, have a dream.\n\nAn untethered seller is a woman who operates from internal authority rather than fear.\n\nIn 2026, I have a dream that women who sell see themselves as untethered sellers.\n\nSellers who choose audacity over avoidance.\nSellers who are no longer tethered to hesitation.\nSellers who untether from comfort and outdated self-images and operate from internal authority.\nSellers who change lives through what they’ve created or through what they are hired to sell.\n\nSellers who step into visibility.\nThey recognize their voice.\nThey own their story.\nThey understand that what they sell is not optional—it is a contribution.\n\nSellers who understand that when uncertainty appears and rejection presents itself, they remain present.\nThey do not retreat.\nThey do not shrink.\nThey stand anchored in the truth:\n“I am here, and I have something of value to offer.”\n\nSellers who choose courage over comfort—when it comes to cold calling, showing up on camera, attending networking events, and speaking publicly about how they serve others.\nThey understand that avoidance delays impact.\n\nSo whether selling for an organization or for themselves, women who sell are sellers who untether from comfort so they can sell the world the solutions it needs.\n\n✨sell yourself on that\n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #ihaveadream #untethered
Last night at a networking event, I noticed something I see almost every time.\n\nThere’s always a woman standing near the edge of the room.\nDrink in hand. Observing. Waiting.\n\nI walked over and started a conversation with her.\n\nShe was articulate. Warm. A great communicator.\nThe kind of presence you don’t expect to be sitting on the sidelines.\n\nShe told me she’s in sales now.\n\nWhat stood out wasn’t that she was new—it was what she said next:\n“I always said I would never do sales.”\n\nAnd yet here she is. A seller.\n\nHer role changed, but her self-image didn’t.\n\nShe shared that she sells—but sparingly.\nThat networking isn’t hard for her.\nWhat’s hard is showing up confidently and taking up space.\n\nThat’s why she stood where she did.\n\nNot because she didn’t belong in the room—\nbut because a part of her still sees sales as something she’s not.\n\nThis isn’t a networking issue.\nIt’s what happens when an old identity follows you into a new assignment.\n\nWhere you stand in the room often mirrors how you show up in sales.\n\nThe work isn’t learning how to network better.\n\nIt’s deciding—internally—that you belong before you show up.\n\n#theuntetheredseller #womensellers #womenwhosell #womeninbusiness #courageovercomfort
Before any sales interaction…\nI used to feel the rejection before it ever happened.\n\nNo one had told me no.\nNo one had rejected me.\nNothing had gone wrong.\n\nBut the anticipation of rejection felt so intense that I’d start rehearsing failure—how I was going to sound, how I was going to look, how obvious it would be that I didn’t belong in the room.\n\nAnd sometimes?\nI wouldn’t show up.\n\nI’d cancel.\nEven if I paid to be there.\nEven if I was excited weeks before.\n\nThe comfort of not showing up felt safer than the discomfort of possibly hearing no.\n\nWhat I didn’t understand at the time was this:\nI didn’t trust myself to feel intensity and still move forward.\n\nI didn’t see myself as someone who could experience anxiety and understand that it was just a feeling—one that would pass.\n\nBecause here’s what I eventually learned.\n\nThe moment I started showing up anyway—choosing courage over comfort—the feeling began to shift.\nNot before.\nNot while thinking about it.\nBut once I was in motion.\n\nThe doom never survived momentum.\n\nAnd the more I showed up, the more my self-image changed.\nI stopped seeing myself as someone who avoids discomfort\nand started seeing myself as someone who can handle it.\n\nI see this pattern all the time with women who sell.\n\nWhen fear takes over, the focus turns inward.\nYou become more concerned with how you’ll be perceived than with the people you’re meant to serve.\n\nAnd that doesn’t just get in the way of selling more.\nIt gets in the way of serving more.\n\nSo imagine the opposite.\n\nImagine feeling excitement about executing instead of anxiety about avoiding.\nImagine trusting yourself enough to show up—even with nerves.\nImagine being more interested in the people you’re called to serve than in protecting yourself from discomfort.\n\nThat shift doesn’t come from more scripts or better technique.\n\nThat’s why I don’t start with strategy. I start with self-image.\n\nSelf-Image That Sells is my most foundational work for women who sell.\n\n✨sell yourself on that\n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #selfimagethatsells untethered
You CARE…\n\nA few years ago, I’d call a friend before almost every sales interaction.\n\nI thought the discomfort I felt (aka fear) meant I wasn’t enough.\nThat maybe what I had to say—or sell—wouldn’t truly land.\n\nAnd every time she said the same thing:\n\n“You feel that way because you care.”\n\nYou care about the impact of your words.\nYou care about providing real value—especially if you’ve invested before and felt let down.\nYou care about serving people well, not just selling to them.\n\nThat’s how an untethered seller interprets those feelings.\n\nNot as a red flag.\nBut as proof of intention.\n\nI once heard Taylor Swift say she expects self-doubt before every performance—not because she’s unprepared, but because she cares about the people who chose to be there.\n\nSo don’t make discomfort mean you’re not ready.\nDon’t make it mean you’re not qualified.\nDon’t make it mean what you offer can’t serve who you’re called to serve.\n\nSometimes those feelings aren’t fear at all.\n\nThey’re evidence that you care.\n\n✨sell yourself on that\n✨the untethered weekly - for women who sell resumes 1/21\n✨what selling fears are you ready to untether from to sell more this year? \n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #fearofrejection #theuntetheredseller
What I know about you:\n\nYou’re not a shy seller.\nYou’re in environments that activate your shyness.\n\nI call this environmental-based shyness.\n\nIt’s why your shyness in sales often shows up as avoiding—not following up, not prospecting, not initiating.\n\nIt’s why you’ve canceled meetings you actually wanted to attend.\n\nNot because you didn’t care—\nbut because your mind started running worst-case scenarios:\n\n🫣What if I get asked something I don’t know?\n🫣What if my mind goes blank?\n🫣What if I say the wrong thing?\n\nThat spiral can feel so overwhelming that canceling feels like relief.\n\nIt’s also why you sometimes hope someone else brings it up. Because initiating feels scary. And if someone else initiates, you don’t have to risk rejection.\n\nBut here’s the quiet truth about sales:\ninitiating happens almost 100% of the time.\n\nProspecting.\nStarting the conversation.\nFollowing up.\nRaising your hand.\n\nIf you’re waiting for someone to reach out first,\nyou’ll likely miss opportunities to help people you’re actually meant to serve.\n\nAnd when you’re in rooms where you believe others are smarter, more confident, more experienced, or more “legitimate” than you—your voice gets quieter. Not because you lack value, but because that environment activates old doubts about being enough.\n\nThis isn’t who you are.\nIt’s what gets activated in certain environments.\n\n#womenwhosell #womeninsales #womeninbusiness
Comfort feels like relief\nCourage feels like resistance\n\nAnd it’s why most sellers mistake relief for alignment.\n\n✨Sell yourself on that\n\n#womenwhosell #womeninbusiness #womeninsales\n#theuntetheredseller #courageovercomfort
How do they feel in your presence? \n\nIn 2016…my husband and I were in South Africa and met a man named Prince at a sushi restaurant.\n\nYes, his role was to serve us.\nBut what stayed with us wasn’t the service.\n\nIt was his presence.\n\nFrom the moment he greeted us, we felt joy, warmth and very welcomed.\n\nI had to take a picture with him—because I didn’t want to forget how he made my husband and I feel.\n\nNearly 10 years later, in December 2025, we returned to South Africa.\n\nWe walked back into that same restaurant, showed the manager the picture, and said, “We don’t remember his name… but we remember him.”\n\nThey smiled and said, “That’s Prince. He’s still here.”\n\nWhen we surprised him that night, he couldn’t stop saying….\nYou remembered my name.\nYou kept the picture.\n\nFor almost a decade, we were still sold on Prince—long after we left the restaurant—not because of what he did,but because of how we felt in his presence.\n\nHere’s what this means for you, if you’re a woman who sells:\n\nStop calling yourself shy.\nStop saying you’re afraid of being seen.\nStop rehearsing the story that you’re not good enough.\n\nThis is what selling looks like when you’re untethered.\nNot driven by pressure, scripts, or performance—\nbut by a presence that lingers.\n\nSo let me ask you this—\nHow do you want others to feel in your presence in 2026?\n\nAnd how committed are you to showing up that way this year?\n\nAs Maya Angelou said,\n“People will never forget how you made them feel.”\n\nAnd I say,\nPeople buy based on how they FEEEL in your presence. \n\n✨sell yourself on that \n\n#courageovercomfort #womenwhosell #womeninsales #womeninbusiness #theuntetheredseller
