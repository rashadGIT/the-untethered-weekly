## Section 2: Problem/Agitation

### Section Heading
Are You Tethered To Your Comfort Zone?

### Problem Card 1: "Doom Feelings"
**Headline:** Fear Before It Even Happens

**Copy:** You feel the rejection before anyone says no. The doom arrives before the sales interaction. And sometimes? You cancel. Even if you paid to be there.

### Problem Card 2: "Old Identity"
**Headline:** Your Past Self-Image Is Following You

**Copy:** Your role changed. But your self-image didn't. You sell now—but sparingly. Because a part of you still sees sales as something you're not.

### Problem Card 3: "Comfort = Relief"
**Headline:** You're Confusing Relief With Alignment

**Copy:** Comfort feels like relief. Courage feels like resistance. So you mistake relief for alignment—and stay tethered to what feels safe.

### Transition Statement (italic, center)
*You're not a shy seller.*
*You're in environments that activate your shyness.*

## Section 3: Solution/Philosophy

### Section Heading
The Untethered Seller Framework

### Intro Paragraph
Most women who sell aren't serving at the level they're capable of—not because they lack skill, but because they're tethered to comfort.

What if you stopped shying away from your calling? What if you chose courage over comfort—and became untethered?

### Framework 1: Self-Image First
**Headline:** Self-Image First

**Copy:** I don't start with strategy. I start with self-image. Because when your identity shifts, your behavior follows.

### Framework 2: Presence Over Performance
**Headline:** Presence Over Performance

**Copy:** People buy based on how they FEEL in your presence. Not your pitch. Not your script. Your presence.

### Framework 3: Momentum Over Mindset
**Headline:** Momentum Over Mindset

**Copy:** The doom never survived momentum. Waiting to feel confident keeps you waiting. Showing up anyway shifts everything.

### Framework 4: Mathematical, Not Emotional
**Headline:** Mathematical, Not Emotional

**Copy:** Low pipeline makes every "no" feel heavier than it is. It's often not emotional—it's mathematical. You just haven't met enough people.

### Framework 5: Internal Authority
**Headline:** Internal Authority

**Copy:** Untethered sellers operate from confidence rather than fear. They don't wait for permission. They choose courage.

> I start with self-image."

## Section 4: About/Credibility

### Section Heading
From Parking Lots To Regional Manager

### Bio Paragraph 1
I started out selling pre-paid legal services in parking lots.

After meeting a prospect in a Walmart parking lot, following up, and taking them through my sales process, I found myself a week later delivering an award-worthy sales presentation to about a dozen of their construction workers—_inside of an empty pool._

### Bio Paragraph 2
In less than a year, I transitioned from an individual contributor role to Regional Sales Manager. I inherited an underperforming region, initially ranked last among five, and elevated it to the #1 position.

### Bio Paragraph 3
How? I taught them how to do one thing better than any other region: _PROSPECT._

### Bio Paragraph 4
I've excelled in various sales roles by choosing courage over comfort. In one corporate role, I elevated my territory by 900% in less than 90 days. While in direct sales, I built a team of 200 within 12 months.

Now, I help women who sell untether from their comfort zones so they can serve more and sell more.
