# Shannon Muruli Brand Website

## Project Overview
Building a personal brand website for Shannon Muruli, a Courage Coach to Women Who Sell, inspired by marieforleo.com's structure and aesthetic.

## Design Guidelines

### Frontend Design Skill
When building UI pages and components for this website, **ALWAYS** refer to and apply the principles from the `frontend-design` skill located at `~/.claude/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`.

Key principles to follow:
- **Bold aesthetic direction**: Choose a distinctive design approach that matches Shannon's brand as a courage coach
- **Typography**: Use beautiful, unique fonts - avoid generic choices like Inter, Roboto, Arial
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic with dominant colors and sharp accents
- **Motion**: Include animations for high-impact moments (page loads, hover states, scroll-triggered effects)
- **Spatial Composition**: Use unexpected layouts, asymmetry, and generous negative space
- **Visual Details**: Add atmospheric depth with gradients, textures, patterns, and layered transparencies
- **Avoid AI aesthetics**: No generic purple gradients, predictable layouts, or cookie-cutter components

- **Positioning**: Courage Coach to Women Who Sell
- **Core Philosophy**: "Courage Over Comfort" (COC mindset)
