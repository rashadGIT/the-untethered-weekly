## 2. Brand & Messaging (UI Interpretation)

### Core Themes Derived from Existing Content

**Primary Brand Framework: "The Untethered Seller"**

Analysis of 408 Instagram posts reveals "The Untethered Seller" as Shannon's primary identity framework for women in sales—distinct from the website's "Courage Over Comfort" positioning. This suggests an evolution in brand messaging that should be reflected in the rebuild.

**Key Brand Pillars (Verified from Social Media):**

1. **"The Untethered Seller"** (17 hashtag uses)
   - Primary identity transformation framework
   - Represents freedom from comfort zone limitations
   - Core positioning: women who cultivate courage to serve and sell more

2. **"Courage Over Comfort" (COC)** (31 hashtag uses)
   - Foundational philosophy challenging fear-based behaviors
   - Established brand asset with visual identity
   - Philosophy that underpins the transformation

3. **"Self-Image First"** (Methodology)
   - "I don't start with strategy. I start with self-image."
   - Core coaching approach extracted from content
   - Differentiator from tactics-first sales coaching

4. **"Presence Over Performance"** (Solution Framework)
   - "People buy based on how they FEEL in your presence."
   - Connection-focused selling vs. transactional
   - Rooted in Maya Angelou quote reference

5. **"Momentum Over Mindset"** (Action Framework)
   - "The doom never survived momentum."
   - Action-first approach vs. waiting for confidence
   - Tactical antidote to fear paralysis

- **The Sell More Soirée** - Live event for women who sell
- **Courage Over Comfort Coaching** - 1-on-1 coaching (from website)

### Voice and Tone Translated into Layout Decisions

**Shannon's Authentic Voice (from 408 posts):**

**Language Patterns:**
- **Short, punchy lines** - Sentence fragments for impact
- **Direct address** - Second-person "You" creates intimacy
- **Rhetorical questions** - "What if you...", "Who are you being when..."
- **Repetition for emphasis** - "I could've been... Instead, I..."
- **Signature CTA** - "✨sell yourself on that" (appears in majority of posts)

**Opening Line Patterns:**
- "Borrow This Belief"
- "Get over yourself"
- "Stay calm"
- "Can I remind you of something?"
- "What I know about you:"

**UI/UX Translation:**
These patterns inform layout decisions:

1. **Headline Strategy**
   - Use short, declarative statements
   - Rhetorical questions as section headers
   - Direct second-person address in hero copy

2. **Content Rhythm**
   - Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
   - Strategic use of bold statements as visual breaks
   - Pull quotes featuring signature frameworks

3. **CTA Integration**
   - "✨sell yourself on that" as signature CTA style
   - Button text uses Shannon's directive voice
   - Multiple CTA types for different readiness levels

4. **Section Pacing**
   - Problem → Solution rhythm (matches Instagram content flow)
   - Personal story integration (NYFW, Cape Town, Prince narratives)
   - Influencer references for credibility (Maxwell, Les Brown, Angelou)

### Navigation Structure Rationale

**marieforleo.com Pattern Applied:**

Marie Forleo's navigation separates:
- **Content** (Blog, MarieTV, Podcast)
- **Commerce** (Courses dropdown)
- **Trust** (About, Success Stories)
- **Utility** (Free Tools, Program Login)

**Shannon's Navigation Should Mirror:**
- **Identity** (Home, About)
- **Services** (Work With Me)
- **Proof** (Client Results)
- **Content** (Resources, Free Downloads)
- **Action** (Contact)

This structure matches different visitor types:
1. **High-intent buyers** → Home → Work With Me → Contact
2. **Researchers** → About → Client Results → Work With Me
3. **Content seekers** → Resources → Free Downloads → Newsletter
4. **Curious visitors** → Home → About → Newsletter

---

## 4. Homepage Strategy (Section-by-Section)

### Overview: 8-Section Architecture

The homepage serves as a strategic funnel, moving visitors from awareness to action through carefully sequenced sections. Each section has a specific conversion objective and builds upon the previous section's momentum.

**Section Flow Logic:**
```
Hero (Hook)
  → Problem (Resonance)
    → Solution (Hope)
      → Credibility (Trust)
        → Proof (Validation)
          → Services (Options)
            → Lead Capture (Engagement)
              → Final Push (Action)
```

---

### Section 1: Hero

**Section Purpose:**
Immediately communicate who Shannon helps and the transformation she delivers. Establish "The Untethered Seller" positioning within 3 seconds of page load.

**Content Focus:**
- **Pre-headline:** "For Women Who Sell" (audience targeting)
- **Primary Headline:** "Become An Untethered Seller" (identity transformation promise)
- **Subheadline:** "Courage Coach & Self-Image Strategist to Women Who Sell" (positioning)
- **Supporting Copy:** "I don't start with strategy. I start with self-image. Because the women who cultivate the courage to untether from their comfort zones will serve more and sell more."
- **Visual:** Professional photo (speaking at podium OR modern office portrait)

**UI Pattern: Full-Screen Hero**
- **Layout:** Full viewport height (100vh minimum)
- **Image Treatment:** Background image with 60-70% dark overlay for text contrast
- **Text Alignment:** Center-aligned, vertically centered
- **Typography:** Large serif headline (60-80px), clean sans-serif subhead (24-30px)
- **Spacing:** Generous padding around text block

**CTA Type:**
- **Primary:** "Start Your Transformation" (high-intent) → Work With Me page
- **Secondary:** "Get Weekly Courage" (low-barrier) → Newsletter signup scroll or modal
- **Button Style:** Solid primary CTA, ghost/outline secondary CTA
- **Placement:** Dual buttons, horizontal alignment on desktop, stacked on mobile

**Structural Inspiration (Non-Visual):**
Marie Forleo's hero uses bold headline + subheadline + dual CTAs pattern. One CTA drives to paid courses (high-intent), the other to free training (low-barrier). This pattern accommodates visitors at different stages of readiness.

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Text contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
- Hero image has descriptive alt text
- CTAs are keyboard accessible with focus states
- Heading hierarchy starts with H1

---

### Section 2: Problem/Agitation

**Section Purpose:**
Mirror visitor pain points to establish emotional resonance and demonstrate understanding of their specific struggles.

**Content Focus:**
- **Section Heading:** "Are You Tethered To Your Comfort Zone?"
- **Problem Cards (3):**
  1. **"Doom Feelings"** - Fear of rejection before sales interactions even happen
  2. **"Old Identity"** - Past self-image following sellers into new roles
  3. **"Comfort = Relief"** - Conflating relief with alignment (comfort vs. courage)
- **Transition Statement:** "You're not a shy seller. You're in environments that activate your shyness."

**UI Pattern: Three-Column Card Grid**
- **Layout:** 3-column grid on desktop, single column stack on mobile
- **Card Design:** White background on light gray section, subtle shadow
- **Icon Treatment:** Minimalist line icons above each problem statement
- **Typography:** Bold problem headlines, regular weight descriptions

**CTA Type:**
No hard CTA—soft transition to solution section. Purpose is resonance, not conversion at this stage.

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo's problem-aware sections use simple statements without heavy emotional manipulation. Clean, scannable format builds trust through empathy rather than fear-mongering.

**Content Note:**
These 3 problems are derived from Shannon's Instagram analysis (408 posts) and represent recurring themes in her content. This is not fabricated—these are patterns identified in her own words across hundreds of posts.

---

### Section 3: Solution/Philosophy

**Section Purpose:**
Introduce Shannon's methodology at a high level without revealing proprietary content. Establish "The Untethered Seller" framework and "Self-Image First" approach as differentiators.

**Content Focus:**
- **Section Heading:** "The Untethered Seller Framework"
- **Intro Copy:** Context-setting paragraph about identity transformation over tactics
- **5 Solution Frameworks:**
  1. **Self-Image First** - "I don't start with strategy. I start with self-image."
  2. **Presence Over Performance** - "People buy based on how they FEEL in your presence."
  3. **Momentum Over Mindset** - "The doom never survived momentum."
  4. **Mathematical, Not Emotional** - "It's often not emotional—it's mathematical. You just haven't met enough people."
  5. **Internal Authority** - "Untethered sellers operate from confidence rather than fear."
- **Pull Quote:** Large stylized quote featuring "Self-Image First" statement with attribution

**UI Pattern: Two-Column Layout**
- **Left Column (60%):** Framework list with numbered or icon-based design
- **Right Column (40%):** Large pull quote, styled with serif typography
- **Card Style:** Light background boxes for each framework, hover effects
- **Visual Hierarchy:** "Self-Image First" visually emphasized as primary approach

**CTA Type:**
- **Primary:** "Discover Self-Image That Sells" → Work With Me page
- **Button Style:** Solid CTA, centered below frameworks
- **Placement:** After frameworks but before next section

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo's "Everything is Figureoutable" philosophy section establishes her worldview without giving away course content. It creates intrigue while positioning her methodology as distinct.

**Content Integrity:**
All 5 frameworks are extracted verbatim from Shannon's Instagram captions. These are her own words synthesized into a coherent framework, not invented methodology.

---

### Section 4: About/Credibility

**Section Purpose:**
Establish Shannon's authority through her personal sales journey and relatability through "I've been where you are" positioning.

**Content Focus:**
- **Section Heading:** "From Parking Lots To Regional Manager"
- **Bio Paragraphs (4-5):**
  1. Origin: "I started out selling pre-paid legal services in parking lots."
  2. Anecdote: "Inside of an empty pool" sales presentation story
  3. Achievement: Last-ranked region to #1 transformation
  4. Results: 900% territory elevation, 200-person team in 12 months

  - **7,415 Followers** - Women who follow her work (Facebook count)
  - **92% Rating** - 15 client reviews (Facebook rating)
- **Photo:** Professional portrait with COC branding visible OR speaking photo

**UI Pattern: Two-Column Layout with Image**
- **Left Column (40%):** Photo, B&W treatment, subtle border
- **Right Column (60%):** Bio text with stats row at bottom
- **Stats Display:** Large numbers (48-60px), small labels, horizontal layout
- **Background:** Light gray or off-white for section differentiation

**CTA Type:**
- **Link-style CTA:** "Read My Full Story →" (arrow indicates continuation)
- **Destination:** About page with expanded narrative
- **Style:** Text link with hover underline, not a heavy button

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo uses condensed founder story with photo, teasing fuller narrative on About page. Stats add quantifiable credibility without relying on unverifiable claims.

**Photo Selection Rationale:**
Photo with COC branding visible reinforces brand identity. Alternatively, speaking photo positions Shannon as thought leader/authority figure.

---

Third-party validation through quantifiable client results. Overcome skepticism with concrete numbers.

- **Contrast:** Dark section (#161317) creates visual break from light sections above/below

**CTA Type:**
- **Primary:** "See More Results →" (even though only 1 testimonial exists)
- **Destination:** Client Results page with structure for future testimonials
- **Button Style:** White outline button on dark background

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo uses testimonial carousels with quantifiable results. Even with one testimonial, the presentation suggests more exist (aspirational design for future growth).

**Content Integrity:**
Winsome Alexander testimonial is quoted verbatim from existing website. All numbers are as stated—no inflation or fabrication. Structure allows for easy addition of future testimonials without redesign.

---

### Section 6: Services Teaser

**Section Purpose:**
Preview coaching offerings and create clear next steps for interested visitors. Name specific programs vs. vague "coaching services."

**Content Focus:**
- **Section Heading:** "Work With Me"
- **Service Cards (3):**

  **1. Self-Image That Sells** (PRIMARY OFFERING)
  - Tag: "Foundational Program"
  - Description: "My most foundational work for women who sell. We start with self-image—not strategy."

  **2. Courage Over Comfort Coaching**
  - Tag: "1-on-1 Coaching"

**CTA Type:**
- **Per-Card CTAs:** "Learn More →" text links on each card
- **Section CTA:** "Explore All Services →" button below grid
- **Dual Action:** Cards for quick decision-makers, button for those needing more info

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo's course section uses 3-column layout with clear program names. Each offering has distinct positioning (foundational, advanced, premium). This pattern helps visitors self-select based on readiness.

**Service Naming Rationale:**
All three program names verified from Instagram/website:
- "Self-Image That Sells" appears in Instagram content
- "Courage Over Comfort Coaching" from existing website
- "The Sell More Soirée" from Instagram posts

No services are fabricated. Structure allows future addition of programs without violating integrity.

---

### Section 7: Newsletter/Lead Magnet

**Section Purpose:**
Capture emails from not-yet-ready visitors. Provide low-friction engagement option for those not ready to book coaching.

- **Whitespace:** Generous padding around form elements

**CTA Type:**
- **Primary:** "Get Weekly Courage" submit button
- **Action:** Form submission → Mailchimp integration (existing)
- **Confirmation:** Redirect to thank-you page or modal confirmation

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo uses prominent email capture with "Free Audio Training" lead magnet. Even without a lead magnet, the newsletter is positioned as valuable content delivery vs. generic "subscribe."

**Lead Magnet Opportunity:**
If Shannon creates a downloadable resource (e.g., "5 Scripts for Fearless Prospecting"), this section can feature it here. Structure accommodates optional lead magnet without requiring one initially.

**Integration Note:**
Existing Mailchimp integration (u=556353bd7923ec61e4fecbdde) can be maintained. No platform migration required for newsletter functionality.

---

- **Text Color:** White, high contrast
- **Button Style:** High contrast buttons (white or accent color)
- **Alignment:** All center-aligned, symmetrical composition

**CTA Type:**
- **Dual CTAs:** High-intent (booking) + low-intent (newsletter)
- **Button Hierarchy:** Primary is larger/more prominent
- **Signature Element:** "✨sell yourself on that" reinforces brand voice

**Structural Inspiration:**
Marie Forleo's terminal CTA uses bold statement + single strong CTA. Pattern ensures visitors who reached page end get one final clear action before footer.

**Signature CTA Note:**
"✨sell yourself on that" appears in majority of Shannon's Instagram posts (408 analyzed). Including it here reinforces authentic voice and brand consistency.

### Content to Rewrite for Clarity and Scannability

**Single-Page to Multi-Page Distribution:**

Current website has all content on one scrolling page. Content needs redistribution across:

1. **Homepage:**
   - Condensed hero statement
   - 3 problem cards (vs. full list)
   - Framework overview (vs. detailed explanation)
   - Bio teaser (vs. full story)
   - Single featured testimonial

2. **About Page:**
   - Full origin story with expanded context
   - Detailed philosophy explanation
   - Personal storytelling integration (NYFW, Cape Town, etc.)
   - Influencer references for credibility

3. **Work With Me:**
   - Detailed program descriptions
   - Process/methodology overview
   - Pricing/packages (if Shannon provides)
   - FAQs about coaching
   - Booking instructions

4. **Client Results:**
   - Winsome Alexander (full case study format)

   - Before/after transformation narratives

**SEO Optimization:**

Current site lacks proper heading hierarchy. Rewrite includes:

  - Homepage: "Become An Untethered Seller"
  - About: "From Parking Lots to Regional Manager: Shannon Muruli's Story"
  - Services: "Sales Coaching for Women Who Sell"

- **H2 tags:** Section headings with natural keyword integration
  - "Are You Tethered To Your Comfort Zone?"
  - "The Untethered Seller Framework"
  - "Work With Me"

- **Meta Descriptions:** Unique per page, 150-160 characters
  - Homepage: "Courage Coach & Self-Image Strategist to Women Who Sell. Become an untethered seller who chooses courage over comfort."
  - About: "Shannon Muruli's journey from parking lot sales to regional management. Learn how she helps women in sales cultivate courage."

- **Alt Text:** Descriptive image alt text
  - "Shannon Muruli speaking at podium"
  - "Shannon Muruli professional portrait with COC branding"

### Content That Can Be Safely Created as High-Level Marketing Copy

**Permissible Non-Specific Content:**

The following can be created as thematic marketing copy derived from existing content:

1. **Benefit Statements (Derived from Problem/Solution Pairs):**
   - "Build prospecting courage that lasts"
   - "Transform your self-image first, sales strategy second"
   - "Move from doom feelings to momentum"
   - "Untether from comfort zones to serve and sell more"
   - "Shift from environmental-based shyness to confident presence"

   **Rationale:** These statements extrapolate from problems Shannon addresses (procrastination, rejection avoidance) to implied outcomes (courage, momentum, confidence). No fabricated claims—just logical benefit framing.

2. **Process Descriptions (Non-Proprietary):**
   - "A coaching approach that addresses mindset, identity, strategy, and accountability"
   - "Self-image work that shifts how you show up in sales conversations"
   - "Framework for choosing courage over comfort in high-stakes moments"

   **Rationale:** Generic coaching language based on Shannon's stated approaches. No proprietary methodology details revealed.

3. **Educational Content Themes (Blog Post Concepts):**
   - "Why Comfort Is Costing You Commissions"
   - "The Real Reason You're Avoiding Prospecting"
   - "Environmental-Based Shyness vs. Inherent Personality"
   - "When Old Identity Follows You Into New Sales Roles"
   - "Pipeline as Math Problem, Not Emotional Problem"

   **Rationale:** All themes extracted from Shannon's Instagram content (408 posts). These are topics she already addresses—structure simply organizes them as educational content.

4. **CTA Text Variations:**
   - "Become An Untethered Seller"
   - "Start Your Transformation"
   - "Get Weekly Courage"
   - "Explore Self-Image That Sells"
   - "Discover Courage Over Comfort Coaching"

   **Rationale:** CTAs use Shannon's own language ("untethered seller", "weekly courage") or generic action verbs ("start", "explore", "discover"). No fabricated promises.

5. **Navigation/Structural Text:**
   - Page titles: "Home", "About", "Work With Me", "Client Results", "Resources", "Contact"
   - Button labels: "Learn More", "Read More", "Book Consultation"
   - Form labels: "Your Email", "First Name", "Message"

   **Rationale:** Standard website UI text with no factual claims.

**Critical Boundaries:**

The following are NEVER fabricated:

- Specific coaching methodologies beyond stated frameworks
- Additional client testimonials or results
- Credentials, certifications, or educational background
- Years of experience claims beyond verified Facebook data (10+ years since 2014)
- Media appearances or press features
- Awards, recognitions, or rankings
- Partnership affiliations
- Specific pricing, guarantees, or promises
- Revenue claims beyond Winsome Alexander testimonial

## 6. Visual & Image Usage Plan

### Available Photography Assets

**Local Assets (./assets/photos/):**

1. **WhatsApp Image 2026-02-01 at 16.22.24.jpeg (160KB)**

   - Use Case: Homepage Services section, Work With Me header (shows coaching dynamic)

**Website Images from Scrape (./assets/website_images/):**

1. **main-page-og-image.png (7.2MB)** - High-res brand imagery, OpenGraph format
2. **home-page-og-image.png (3.9MB)** - High-res brand imagery, OpenGraph format
3. **join-page-og-image.jpg (86KB)** - Professional photo for social sharing

### Image Placement Strategy

**Homepage:**

| Section | Image | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Hero** | 16.23.46 (formal portrait) OR 16.25.13 (speaking) | Establishes immediate credibility. Speaking photo positions as thought leader; formal portrait emphasizes professionalism. |
| **Problem** | None (clean section) | Focus on text readability. Icons only. |
| **Solution** | None or subtle background pattern | Keep focus on framework content. |
| **About Teaser** | 16.23.21 (COC branding visible) | Reinforces brand identity. Small portrait size appropriate for teaser. |
| **Social Proof** | None (optional: Winsome headshot if provided) | Dark background section—photo would need careful contrast handling. |
| **Services** | 16.25.36 (coaching in action) | Shows what working together looks like. Dynamic image energizes section. |
| **Newsletter** | None | Form-focused section. |
| **Final CTA** | None | Dark text-focused section. |

**About Page:**
- **Header:** 16.23.46 (formal) OR 16.22.24 (approachable)
- **Story Section:** 16.25.13 (speaking) positioned mid-page
- **Philosophy Section:** 16.23.21 (smaller, inline with text)

**Work With Me:**
- **Header:** 16.25.36 (coaching dynamic)
- **Program Sections:** Rotate through remaining photos or use illustrations

**Client Results:**
- **Header:** 16.25.13 (authority positioning)
- **Testimonials:** Client photos if provided, otherwise text-only cards

**Contact:**
- **Header:** 16.22.24 (most approachable, invites connection)

### Layout and Responsiveness Considerations

**Image Sizing:**

- **Hero Images:** 1920x1080px minimum for full-width backgrounds
- **Portrait Images:** 800x1200px for About page headers
- **Thumbnail Images:** 400x400px for service cards
- **Social Sharing:** 1200x630px for OpenGraph images

**Responsive Behavior:**

1. **Desktop (>1024px):**
   - Full-width hero backgrounds with parallax scroll optional
   - Two-column layouts with image + text
   - Large portrait images (600-800px width)

2. **Tablet (768-1024px):**
   - Hero images scale proportionally
   - Two-column layouts maintained, slightly narrower
   - Portrait images reduce to 400-600px width

3. **Mobile (<768px):**
   - Hero images crop to focus on Shannon (object-position: center 30%)
   - All layouts stack to single column
   - Portrait images full-width but height-constrained (max 400px)
   - Background images may switch to solid color with photo below

**Image Optimization:**

- **Format:** WebP with JPG fallback for wider browser support
- **Lazy Loading:** All images below fold use native lazy loading (loading="lazy")
- **Compression:** Target 80-85% quality for optimal balance
- **Srcset:** Provide 1x, 2x, 3x versions for high-DPI displays
- **Expected File Sizes:**
  - Hero backgrounds: 150-300KB (compressed WebP)
  - Portrait photos: 50-100KB
  - Thumbnails: 20-40KB

### Accessibility Considerations

**Alt Text Strategy:**

- **Descriptive, not decorative:** "Shannon Muruli speaking at podium" vs. "woman speaking"
- **Context-aware:** Same photo may have different alt text depending on page context
- **No redundancy:** If caption describes image, alt text focuses on visual details

**Examples:**
- Hero: "Shannon Muruli, Courage Coach to Women Who Sell, professional portrait"
- About: "Shannon Muruli delivering keynote presentation on sales courage"
- Services: "Shannon Muruli coaching session with women in sales"

**Color Contrast:**

All photos are B&W, which simplifies contrast management:
- Light images on dark backgrounds achieve 7:1 contrast (WCAG AAA)
- Dark overlays on photos ensure text contrast of 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA)
- No color-dependent information (colorblind-friendly)

**Image Placement & Cropping:**

- **Face Detection:** Ensure Shannon's face is never cropped in critical areas (hero, about)
- **Focus Point:** Set CSS object-position to keep face in frame on mobile crops
- **Safe Zones:** Maintain 10% padding on all sides for text overlays

   - Structure allows for future additions
   - No placeholder testimonials or fabricated quotes

2. **"As Seen On" Logos:**

   - No press mentions on website or social media
   - Section omitted entirely vs. using placeholder logos

3. **Credentials/Certifications:**
   - None publicly stated on website or social media
   - No "ICF Certified" or similar claims
   - Authority comes from sales results, not credentials

4. **Client Company Logos:**

**Integrity Approach:**

## Appendix: Structural Inspiration Reference

### marieforleo.com Structural Analysis

**What We Adopt (Structure Only):**

1. **Multi-Level Conversion Funnel:**
   - **High-intent:** Course enrollment → "Start Your Transformation" (book coaching)
   - **Mid-intent:** Free training downloads → "Download PDF" (lead magnet)
   - **Low-intent:** Newsletter signup → "Get Weekly Courage" (email list)
   - **Application:** Shannon's site needs same tiered approach for different readiness levels

2. **Homepage Section Sequencing:**
   ```
   Marie Forleo:
   Hero → Free Offer → Founder Story → Media Logos → Course Feature →
   Content Hub → Book → Podcast → Testimonials → Final CTA

   Shannon's Adaptation:
   Hero → Problem → Solution → About Teaser → Testimonial →
   Services → Newsletter → Final CTA
   ```
   - **Pattern:** Build authority before asking for commitment
   - **Difference:** Shannon has 1 testimonial vs. Marie's carousel (structural accommodation for future growth)

3. **Navigation Clarity:**
   - Marie separates: About | Courses | Content (Blog/TV/Podcast) | Shop
   - Shannon separates: About | Work With Me | Client Results | Resources | Contact
   - **Pattern:** Clear page separation by purpose, not overcrowded nav

4. **CTA Placement Strategy:**
   - Marie: Multiple CTAs per page, different intent levels
   - Shannon: Dual CTAs in hero (high + low intent), repeated in final section
   - **Pattern:** Reduce single-point-of-failure, offer options

5. **Visual Rhythm:**
   - Marie: Alternating light/dark sections, image-left/image-right variation
   - Shannon: Same pattern—dark testimonial section, light problem section, etc.
   - **Pattern:** Prevents visual monotony, guides eye through page

6. **Content Depth:**
   - Marie: Dedicated pages for each major offering (B-School, Copy Cure, Time Genius)
   - Shannon: Dedicated "Work With Me" page with all programs (fewer offerings, simpler structure)
   - **Pattern:** Match complexity to offering portfolio size

**What We Don't Adopt (Branding/Content):**

1. **No copying of:**
   - Wording, taglines, or value propositions ("Everything is Figureoutable" is Marie's, not applicable)
   - Visual design, color schemes, or branding aesthetics
   - Proprietary program names or methodology terminology
   - Specific CTA language (Marie's "Tell Me Everything" vs. Shannon's "Start Your Transformation")

2. **Structural differences due to business model:**
   - Marie has multiple courses (B-School, Copy Cure, Time Genius) → Shannon has 3 programs (simpler)
   - Marie has extensive content hub (Blog, MarieTV, Podcast) → Shannon has newsletter + future blog (lighter)
   - Marie has shop/merch → Shannon may add merch future (not Phase 1)

**Key Takeaway:**

marieforleo.com provides a **proven information architecture pattern** for personal brand websites. We adopt the structure (multi-page, clear nav, tiered CTAs, section sequencing) while building entirely unique content reflecting Shannon's authentic brand voice and verified achievements.
