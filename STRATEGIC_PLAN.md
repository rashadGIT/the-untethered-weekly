## 1. Executive Summary

### High-Level Vision
Transform theuntetheredweekly.com into a professional, conversion-optimized platform that positions Shannon as the definitive Courage Coach to Women Who Sell. The rebuilt site will retain the authentic "Courage Over Comfort" (COC) brand messaging while implementing a clear information hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and strategic conversion paths inspired by high-performing personal brand websites.
