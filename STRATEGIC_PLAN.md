## 1. Executive Summary

### High-Level Vision
Transform theuntetheredweekly.com into a professional, conversion-optimized platform that positions Shannon as the definitive Courage Coach to Women Who Sell.

### Section 2: Problem/Agitation
**Objective:** Mirror visitor pain points to establish resonance

**Content Focus:**
Rewrite existing content addressing:
- "Are you avoiding the very activities that would grow your sales?"

## 5. Content Strategy

### Content to Reuse As-Is

**From theuntetheredweekly.com:**
1. Core positioning statement: "Courage Coach to Women Who Sell"
2. Testimonial: Winsome Alexander + results (300%, 425%)
3. Personal sales journey (pre-paid legal origin story)
4. "Courage Over Comfort" brand language
5. "Connection Over Selling" philosophy statement
6. Newsletter name: "The Untethered Weekly"
7. Problem statements (procrastination, rejection fear, cold calling resistance)

**Verified Elements:**
- Mailchimp integration (existing)
- Link to "Serve More & Sell More" (existing resource reference)

### Content to Rewrite or Reorganize

**For Clarity:**
1. Service descriptions - expand from single-page mentions to dedicated service page content
2. About section - expand founder story with more context (while avoiding fabrication)
3. Problem/solution articulation - break into digestible sections across pages

**For Structure:**
1. Distribute single-page content across multi-page architecture
2. Create page-specific CTAs (currently only newsletter signup)
3. Develop clear navigation hierarchy

**For SEO:**
1. Add H1/H2 structure to content (currently minimal)
2. Create meta descriptions for each page
3. Develop keyword-focused headings (e.g., "Coaching for Women Who Sell," "Overcome Sales Call Reluctance")

### Content That Can Be Created as High-Level Marketing Copy

**Permissible Non-Specific Content:**
1. Benefit statements derived from existing themes:
   - "Build prospecting courage that lasts"
   - "Transform fear into fuel for your sales career"
   - "Sell with authenticity and exceed your targets"

2. Process/approach descriptions (non-proprietary):
   - "A coaching approach that addresses mindset, strategy, and accountability"
   - "Customized support for your unique sales challenges"
   - "Proven frameworks for sustainable sales growth"

3. Educational content themes (based on existing problem statements):
   - "Why comfort is costing you commissions"
   - "The real reason you're avoiding prospecting"
   - "How to make rejection your competitive advantage"

**Critical Rule:**
All created content must be:
- Thematically derived from existing Shannon Muruli content
- Generic enough to be non-fabricated
- Free of specific claims, credentials, or methodologies not publicly stated
- Clearly distinguished as marketing extrapolation (not quoted content)

---

## 6. Visual & Image Usage Plan

### Available Assets (./assets/photos/)

**Photo Inventory:**
1. **16.22.24.jpeg** - Outdoor casual portrait (B&W, sunglasses, confident pose)
2. **16.23.21.jpeg** - Professional headshot with COC branding visible (cafe setting)
3. **16.23.46.jpeg** - Formal professional portrait (modern lobby, elegant attire)
4. **16.25.13.jpeg** - Speaking engagement (at podium, professional attire)
5. **16.25.36.jpeg** - Coaching/workshop session (engaging with group)

### Placement Recommendations

**Homepage:**
- Hero: 16.23.46 (formal authority) OR 16.25.13 (thought leader speaking)
- About teaser: 16.23.21 (COC branding visible - reinforces brand)
- Services teaser: 16.25.36 (coaching in action - shows what working together looks like)

**About Page:**
- Primary: 16.22.24 (approachable, personal) OR 16.23.46 (professional credibility)
- Secondary: 16.25.13 (establishes speaking/thought leadership)

**Work With Me:**
- Header: 16.25.36 (shows coaching dynamic)
- Supporting: 16.23.21 (professional warmth)

**Client Results:**
- Header: 16.25.13 (authority/results-delivery positioning)

**Contact:**
- 16.22.24 (most approachable, invites connection)

### Technical Considerations
- All photos are B&W (cohesive aesthetic - intentional design choice)
- High resolution (suitable for web use)
- Professional quality (no amateur/phone snapshots)
- Mix of contexts: speaking, coaching, professional portraits, casual

### Future Visual Guidance

**Without Fabrication, Future Visual Needs:**
- Additional testimonial photos (if clients provide permission)
- Behind-the-scenes coaching content (if Shannon produces)
- Workshop/event photography (if public events occur)
- Brand graphics using COC visual identity (if brand guide exists)

**Avoid:**
- Stock photography of generic business women (undermines authenticity)
- Fabricated team photos (Shannon appears to be solo practitioner)
- AI-generated imagery inconsistent with existing B&W aesthetic
- Any visuals implying scale/credentials not verified
